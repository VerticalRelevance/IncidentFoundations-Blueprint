# Incident Response Foundations-Blueprint
6/15/2022

NOTE: At the time of the original implementation, Cloudformation does not 
support the resources required to implement this reference architecture 
and example remediation as IAC. The only way to automate the deployment 
was through SDKs or Terraform.  

This solution uses Terraform for the deployment and management of resources.  
Once Cloudformation/CDK implement the resources required for this solution
the templates will be revisited and implemented using native AWS IAC so as
to align with all other VR reference designs and solutions.
